---

We've presented echinopscis at the XX International Botanical Congress in Madrid, Spain as part of a symposium called "Taxonomy as Open Science: Tool support to facilitate data use for hands-on practitioners".

We explained our aim in developing the tool - we wanted something that sat between the two traditional ways to deliver technology. We didn't want to build a website (as its harder to integrate your own data and working practices in this kind of project) and we didn't want to deliver an API, as you need to be a programmer to use this effectively. We wanted to enable the use of advanced technology without requiring advanced technical skills. 

This presentation includes a number of short demo videos, showing how you can use different Obsidian plugins (some developed through this project, so externally developed and customised here).

## Wikidata

This plugin allows you to use an identifier in the frontmatter of a page to gather a list of related identifiers from Wikidata - using Wikidata as a "switchboard" to access related records elsewhere

## Glossary

This plugin shows how you can look up a technical botanical term in a glossary - so that you have a reference resource side by side as you work.

## Phylogeny viewer / navigation of notes

This demo shows how we can render a phylogenetic tree from newick text and use it to navigate your personal library of references and notes

## AI "co-pilot" 

Now a couple of demos which show how we can connect your local research notes to a remote AI assistant (a large language model).

### Extraction of specimen references

This shows how we can reformat specimens examined paragraphs from your library of references into a table of specimen data - using the Darwin Core data standard from [Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG)](https://www.tdwg.org)

### Reformatting descriptive data to trait matrices

Now we're reformatting descriptive data into tabular form, so that we have a trait dataset from a text input.

## Checklist

We finished with a checklist of practical actions for the audience - if you're interested in the toolkit how can you get involved?

- Review the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17YD81kMce2poCM-PCaEZ_OhpAhddggSP/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114263942339372339976&rtpof=true&sd=true)
- [Sign up to github](https://github.com/signup) - also useful for participating other projects like GBIF. 
- Participate on the [discussion board](https://github.com/orgs/echinopscis/discussions)
- Particularly: 
    - If we made a pre-populated echinopscis vault for your group, what data should we include? 
    - What kind of collaboration features do you need?
