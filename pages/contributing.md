We welcome contributions - and these don't have to be technical in nature - feature requests, questions and suggestions are all helpful. These are all managed as github issues - so you'll need to [sign up for a github login](https://github.com/signup), and then you can add issues or comment on existing discussions.

## Ideas for potential contributions

- Evaluation of the software using an existing group of collaborators
- Documentation of working practices - especially those defining information resources that need to be searched and linked, and data repositories which need to be populated as part of the publication process
- Definition of requirements
- Plugin development, e.g.:
	- Visualisation plugin to display phylogenies
- Development of quickadd scripts and templates, e.g.:
	- Quickadd plugin to access genomic resources
- Documentation of useful plugins, or how to configure / use in different ways, e.g.:
	- Display of TDWG World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions polygons on leaflet map
- Evaluation of alternative personal knowledge management software - alternatives to Obsidian such as [logseq](https://logseq.com/) etc. 

## Why use github?
Our colleagues at [GBIF](https://github.com/GBIF), [Atlas of Living Australia](https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia), [iDigBio](https://github.com/iDigBio), [Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG)](https://github.com/TDWG) and many other organisations use github to manage their projects  - including documentation and community-building as well as the management of technical resources like source code. If you've ever submitted feedback or reported a problem via the  GBIF data portal, your report would have resulted in a ["portal-feedback"](https://github.com/gbif/portal-feedback) github issue, meaning that other users have maximum visibility of known issues, work-arounds and fixes. Management of issues and proposed features "in the open" also enables users to participate in prioritisation. The github environment is well-documented and many open science curricula cover the usage basics. In the future, if it is necessary to move from github to a different platform, we would be able to collaborate and learn from our colleagues about how best to do this.
