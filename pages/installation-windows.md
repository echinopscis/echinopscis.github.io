1. [Download](https://github.com/echinopscis/echinopscis-sample-vault/releases/download/v0.1.5/echinopscis-sample-vault-0.1.5.zip) the echinopscis sample vault. ("Vault" is the Obsidian term for a workspace or project; the contents of a vault are "pages", arranged into "folders"). This vault is zipped and pre-configured with plugins for data access and visualisation of biodiversity informatics data.

1. Launch Obsidian. If its the first time you have opened Obsidian, you will be shown a set of three choices (create new / open existing / download remote). You should choose the second of the three options, ie "Open folder as vault". You'll be shown a file chooser, where you can navigate to, or paste in the folder saved in the previous step

**Note** if you have an older version of obsidian, this message may be titled "Safe mode" and ask if you wish to disable safe mode and enable third party plugins. Click "Turn off safe mode".

These instructions are "pinned" so that  they remain visible in the lefthand pane, whilst you create and navigate to new pages in the pane on the right.
