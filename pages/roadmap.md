The current work has been an experiment in delivering a research working environment. We hope to further develop this work, and extend it to fit with later stages of the research process:

1. **Personal research environment** based on Markdown authoring and linking (current focus)
1. **Web publication** using static site generators: Obsidian generated markdown can be processed to generate a static website. We see conceptual similarities with the [GBIF hosted portal](https://www.gbif.org/hosted-portals) work here.
1. **Document production**: pipelines to process markdown and structured bibliographic/specimen references to document formats like Word, PDF and HTML.
1. **Dataset production**: tools to process markdown and YAML frontmatter to DarwinCore.
