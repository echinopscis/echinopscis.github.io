"echinopscis" is an experiment in creating a working environment that allows researchers to write, access data and create links between literature, specimens, names, institutions, people, traits etc.

The main principle has been to provide small pieces of functionality that can be combined in many different ways, enabling researchers to be "open to choose" how to organise their work.

We also aim that any skills necessary to work with this toolkit would be transferable to other open science tools and practices - that if you invest in time exploring this prototype software, the things you learn (markdown formatting, bibliography / citation management, document production etc) could also be applied elsewhere in your work, or in other working environments.

All code and documentation (and this project site) are managed on [github](https://github.com/echinopscis).
