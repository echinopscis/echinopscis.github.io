The echinopscis experiment has grown from a set of discussions between researchers in two of the science priorities defined by [RBG Kew](https://www.kew.org/science): - [Digital Revolution](https://www.kew.org/science/our-science/departments/digital-revolution) and [Accelerated Taxonomy](https://www.kew.org/science/our-science/departments/accelerated-taxonomy). Our discussion series early in 2022 focussed on the need for information tools to support taxonomy, to enable researchers to explore and develop data, to maximise use of existing resources and to publish traditional outputs (articles) and datasets faster, to a wider audience.
