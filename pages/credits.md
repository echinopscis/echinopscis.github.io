- Libby Ellwood and James Macklin (both from the "international partners" group convened to discuss alignment of activities relevant to the digital extended specimen concept), and Visotheary Ung (TDWG, P). NN also participated in outline discussions on the use of graph technologies to develop a "taxonomic mind mapper" with Mark Watson (E) and Peter Hovenkamp (Lâ€ ) - thanks to them both.
