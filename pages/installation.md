1. [Download](https://github.com/echinopscis/echinopscis-sample-vault/archive/refs/tags/v0.1.2.zip) the echinopscis sample vault. ("Vault" is the Obsidian term for a workspace or project; the contents of a vault are "pages", arranged into "folders"). This vault is zipped and pre-configured with plugins for data access and visualisation of biodiversity informatics data. When the download is complete, you should extract the zip file to a directory on your computer.
1. [Download](https://obsidian.md/download) and install Obsidian for your operating system. 
1. Launch Obsidian. You will be given three options, to: 

    - Create a new vault
    - Open a folder as a vault
    - Open a remote vault. 

    Select the middle option: "Open folder as vault". Choose the directory that you extracted in step 1. 
    
    **Security**: You will be asked to confirm that you trust the author of the vault, so that plugins can be enabled. Click  "Trust author and enable plugins". You will be shown a list of the plugins contained in the vault, you can exit this listing using the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key.
    - **Note for users of older versions of Obsidian**: this message may be titled "Safe mode" and ask if you wish to disable safe mode and enable third party plugins. Click "Turn off safe mode".
1. Explore - or work through the steps listed in the pinned "start here" page.
