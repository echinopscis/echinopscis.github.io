*echinopscis* is an experiment in creating an "extensible notebook for open science on specimens". We're a group of biodiversity & informatics researchers trying to make it easier to access the information resources (specimens, literature, descriptions) needed to describe and protect biodiversity. We want to enable flexible working practices, so that researchers can collate and publish work with actionable links to evidence. This effort is part of the groundwork towards the "digital extended specimen".
